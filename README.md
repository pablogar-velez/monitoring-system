# Real-Time Sensor Monitoring System

## Overview

This project is a cross-platform application designed for real-time monitoring, visualization, and logging of environmental sensor data. It supports both live data acquisition from microcontrollers via serial communication and simulated data generation for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Acquisition**: Connects to microcontrollers through serial ports to receive live sensor data.
- **Data Simulation Mode**: Generates synthetic sensor data for testing without hardware.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Utilizes PyQtGraph for real-time plotting of temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels.
- **Configurable Interface**: Allows selection of COM ports and baud rates through a user-friendly GUI.
- **Data Logging**: Saves collected data with timestamps into CSV files for further analysis.
- **Responsive GUI**: Built with PyQt5, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
